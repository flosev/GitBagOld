 *  Маркер-аннотация для контроллеров из MVC (Model-View-Controller)

 *  At the heart of MVC, and the idea that was the most influential to later frameworks, is what I call Separated Presentation. The idea behind Separated Presentation is to make a clear division between domain objects that model our perception of the real world, and presentation objects that are the GUI elements we see on the screen.</a>
 *  <br/><br/>
 *  <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html">
 *  The controller's job is to take the user's input and figure out what to do with it.</a>
 *  <br/><br/>
 *  At this point I should stress that there's not just one view and controller, you have a view-controller pair for each element of the screen, each of the controls and the screen as a whole.
 *  <br/><br/>
 *  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">The model consists of application data, business rules, logic, and functions.</a>
